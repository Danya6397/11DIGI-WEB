        <h1>About Mynd</h1>
        <div class="fill">
            <p1>Mynd is a website made for teenagers. To inspire and encourage them to take a step into the outdoors. <br> I myself have often found myself hunched over a phone on a Sunday morning with nothing better to do. I know how hard it is to pry your eyes away from the screen and do something genuinely helpful for your body. Hence why I created Mynd. An easy to access website with inspiring pictures of places where you can easily go for a stroll. </p1>
            <br><p2>Studies have shown that spending time outside reduces levels of stress, anxiety and depression for teenagers. With the impact of social media these symptoms have been increasingly common. However, being in the outdoors can counteract the effects. Being in nature can lead to increased creativity, better sleep, a healthier immune system and a better mood overall. Although it may seem difficult or too bothersome, trust me when I say that starting now will make a huge difference. If the walks through the nature parks seem a little too much for you, even just a walk around your own neighbourhood can help. Here are some more inspirational images to help you get started!</p2>
